    /// be created (therefore, no side-effect possible) until the downstream sends demand (`.demand > .none`). This, of course,
    /// if it was not created yet before passed to this initializer.
    /// That way, you can safely add `Future` as upstream, for example, and be sure that its side-effect won't be started. The
    /// behaviour, then, will be similar to `Deferred<Future<Output, Failure>>`, however with some extra features such as better
    /// zips, and a run function to easily start the effect. The cancellation is possible and will be forwarded to the upstream
    /// if the effect had already started.

    /// hardcoded success or failure values, or from a Result. In any of these cases, the evaluation of the value will be deferred
